     * Dots for example do not work: MyContext.Something
     * Either use MyContext_Something or just MyContextSomething. Event machine is best suited for single context
     * services anyway, so in most cases you don't need to set a context in front of your queries because the context
     * is defined by the service boundaries itself.
     *
     * For a clean and simple API (when using GraphQL integration) it is recommended to just use the name of the "thing"
     * you want to return as query name, see example for user queries:

     * @example
     *
